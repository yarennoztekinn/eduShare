     
EduShare is a platform designed to enhance communication and collaboration among university students. 

- The application allows users to create and browse lesson advertisements, 
- enabling students to share their expertise or seek help in various academic subjects. 
- Users can also send notifications to the advertisement owners, fostering seamless connections and communication.

Future updates aim to introduce a forum feature for open discussions and a map-based notification system to display live events and announcements in specific locations. 

EduShare is built using Java with the Spring Framework, PostreSQL for data management, and a simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
